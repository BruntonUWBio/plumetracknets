  abstract = {Many animal behaviours require orientation and steering with respect to the environment. For insects, a key brain area involved in spatial orientation and navigation is the central complex. Activity in this neural circuit has been shown to track the insect{\textquoteright}s current heading relative to its environment, and has also been proposed to be the substrate of path integration. However, it remains unclear how the output of the central complex is integrated into motor commands. Central complex output neurons project to the lateral accessory lobes (LAL), from which descending neurons project to thoracic motor centres. Here, we present a computational model of a simple neural network that has been described anatomically and physiologically in the LALs of male silkworm moths, in the context of odour-mediated steering. We present and analyze two versions of this network, both implemented in the Nengo framework, one rate-based and one based on spiking neurons. The modelled network consists of an inhibitory local interneuron and a bistable descending neuron ({\textquoteleft}flip-flop{\textquoteright}), which both receive input in the LAL. The flip-flop neuron projects onto neck motor neurons to induce steering. We show that this simple computational model not only replicates the basic parameters of male silkworm moth behaviour in a simulated odour plume, but can also take input from a computational model of path integration in the central complex and use it to steer back to a point of origin. Furthermore, we find that increasing the level of detail within the model improves the realism of the model{\textquoteright}s behaviour. Our results suggest that descending neurons originating in the lateral accessory lobes, such as flip-flop neurons, are sufficient to mediate multiple steering behaviours. This study is therefore a first step to close the gap between orientation circuits in the central complex and downstream motor centres.Author summary Targeted movements and steering within an environment are essential for many behaviours. In insects, the brain{\textquoteright}s center for spatial orientation and navigation is the central complex, which processes information about the configuration of the local environment as well as global orientation cues such as the Sun position. Neural networks in the central complex also compute the insect{\textquoteright}s heading direction, and are thought to be involved in generating steering commands. However, it is unclear how these steering commands are transmitted to downstream motor centers. Output neurons from the central complex project to the lateral accessory lobes, a neuropil which also gives rise to descending pre-motor neurons that are involved in steering in the silkworm moth Bombyx mori. In this study, we provide a computational model of a pre-motor neural network in the lateral accessory lobes. We show that this network can steer an agent towards the source of a simulated odor plume, but that it can also steer efficiently when getting input from an anatomically constrained network model of the central complex. This model is therefore a first step to close the gap between the central complex and thoracic motor circuits.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {How insects navigate complex odor plumes, where the location and timing of odor packets are uncertain, remains unclear. Here we imaged complex odor plumes simultaneously with freely-walking flies, quantifying how behavior is shaped by encounters with individual odor packets. We found that navigation was stochastic and did not rely on the continuous modulation of speed or orientation. Instead, flies turned stochastically with stereotyped saccades, whose direction was biased upwind by the timing of prior odor encounters, while the magnitude and rate of saccades remained constant. Further, flies used the timing of odor encounters to modulate the transition rates between walks and stops. In more regular environments, flies continuously modulate speed and orientation, even though encounters can still occur randomly due to animal motion. We find that in less predictable environments, where encounters are random in both space and time, walking flies navigate with random walks biased by encounter timing.},

  abstract = {Studies dating back a century (Flugge, 1934) have stressed the critical role of the wind as the primary directional cue in odor plume navigation. Here, we show that Drosophila shape their navigational decisions using a second directional cue - the direction of motion of odors - which they detect from the temporal correlations of the odor signal between their two antennae. Using a high-resolution virtual reality paradigm to deliver spatiotemporally complex fictive odors to freely-walking flies, we demonstrate that such odor direction sensing is computationally equivalent to motion detection algorithms underlying motion detection in vision. Simulations and theoretical analysis of turbulent plumes reveal that odor motion contains valuable directional information absent from the airflow; indeed, this information is used by both Drosophila and virtual agents to navigate naturalistic odor environments. The generality of our findings suggests that odor direction sensing is likely used throughout the animal kingdom, and could significantly improve olfactory robot navigation in harsh chemical environments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Neuroscience needs behavior. However, it is daunting to render the behavior of organisms intelligible without suppressing most, if not all, references to life. When animals are treated as passive stimulus-response, disembodied and identical machines, the life of behavior perishes. Here, we distill three biological principles (materiality, agency, and historicity), spell out their consequences for the study of animal behavior, and illustrate them with various examples from the literature. We propose to put behavior back into context, with the brain in a species-typical body and with the animal’s body situated in the world; stamp Newtonian time with nested ontogenetic and phylogenetic processes that give rise to individuals with their own histories; and supplement linear cause-and-effect chains and information processing with circular loops of purpose and meaning. We believe that conceiving behavior in these ways is imperative for neuroscience.}

abstract = {Biological neuronal networks (BNNs) are a source of inspiration and analogy making for researchers that focus on artificial neuronal networks (ANNs). Moreover, neuroscientists increasingly use ANNs as a model for the brain. Despite certain similarities between these two types of networks, important differences can be discerned. First, biological neural networks are sculpted by evolution and the constraints that it entails, whereas artificial neural networks are engineered to solve particular tasks. Second, the network topology of these systems, apart from some analogies that can be drawn, exhibits pronounced differences. Here, we examine strategies to construct recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that instantiate the network topology of brains of different species. We refer to such RNNs as bio-instantiated. We investigate the performance of bio-instantiated RNNs in terms of: i) the prediction performance itself, that is, the capacity of the network to minimize the desired function at hand in test data, and ii) speed of training, that is, how fast during training the network reaches its optimal performance. We examine bio-instantiated RNNs in working memory tasks where task-relevant information must be tracked as a sequence of events unfolds in time. We highlight the strategies that can be used to construct RNNs with the network topology found in BNNs, without sacrificing performance. Despite that we observe no enhancement of performance when compared to randomly wired RNNs, our approach demonstrates how empirical neural network data can be used for constructing RNNs, thus, facilitating further experimentation with biologically realistic network topologies, in contexts where such aspect is desired.}

abstract = {Research on human and animal behavior has long emphasized its hierarchical structure—the divisibility of ongoing behavior into discrete tasks, which are comprised of subtask sequences, which in turn are built of simple actions. The hierarchical structure of behavior has also been of enduring interest within neuroscience, where it has been widely considered to reflect prefrontal cortical functions. In this paper, we reexamine behavioral hierarchy and its neural substrates from the point of view of recent developments in computational reinforcement learning. Specifically, we consider a set of approaches known collectively as hierarchical reinforcement learning, which extend the reinforcement learning paradigm by allowing the learning agent to aggregate actions into reusable subroutines or skills. A close look at the components of hierarchical reinforcement learning suggests how they might map onto neural structures, in particular regions within the dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex. It also suggests specific ways in which hierarchical reinforcement learning might provide a complement to existing psychological models of hierarchically structured behavior. A particularly important question that hierarchical reinforcement learning brings to the fore is that of how learning identifies new action routines that are likely to provide useful building blocks in solving a wide range of future problems. Here and at many other points, hierarchical reinforcement learning offers an appealing framework for investigating the computational and neural underpinnings of hierarchically structured behavior.}
